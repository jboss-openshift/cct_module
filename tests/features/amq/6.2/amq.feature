Feature: Openshift AMQ tests

  Scenario: check that container is started correctly
    When container is ready
    Then container log should contain INFO | Apache ActiveMQ 5.11.0.redhat-621186
    And check that port 61616 is open

  Scenario: Check that the labels are correctly set

    Then the image should contain label com.redhat.component with value jboss-amq-6-amq62-openshift-docker
    And the image should contain label name with value jboss-amq-6/amq62-openshift

  # https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-180
  Scenario: Check if image version and release is printed on boot
    When container is ready
    Then container log should contain Running jboss-amq-6/amq62-openshift image, version

  Scenario: Check that the readinessProbe correctly identifies the transport ports
    When container is started with env
       | variable                    | value                    |
