#TODO: @slaskawi
# HTTPS tests don't make much sense in JDG. The only thing that is worth testing is HTTP with REST.
# However due to regression, we don't support encryption in REST interface (at least in JDG 7 and 7.1.Beta).
# We have two options from this point:
#  1) rewrite those tests for JDG 7.1 only
#  2) remove them completely
