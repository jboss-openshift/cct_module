- name: JAVA_MAIN_CLASS
  description: ^
    A main class to use as argument for `java`. When this environment variable
    is given, all jar files in **JAVA_APP_DIR** are added to the classpath as
    well as **JAVA_LIB_DIR**.
  example: "com.example.MainClass"

- name: JAVA_LIB_DIR
  description: ^
    Directory holding the Java jar files as well an optional `classpath` file
    which holds the classpath. Either as a single line classpath (colon
    separated) or with jar files listed line-by-line. If not set
    **JAVA_LIB_DIR** is the same as **JAVA_APP_DIR**.

- name: JAVA_DATA_DIR
  description: ^
    The location of the directory which should be used by the application for

  example: "/var/cache/application"

- name: JAVA_CLASSPATH
  description: ^
    The classpath to use. If not given, the startup script checks for a file
    `**JAVA_APP_DIR/classpath**` and use its content literally as classpath. If

    (`classes:**JAVA_APP_DIR/***`).
