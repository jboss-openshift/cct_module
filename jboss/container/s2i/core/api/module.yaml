description: ^
  Defines environment variables and labels used by S2I.  Modules implementing
  S2I capabilities should use these variables accordingly.

labels:
- name: "io.openshift.s2i.scripts-url"
  value: "image:///usr/local/s2i"
- name: io.openshift.s2i.destination
  value: "/tmp"
- name: org.jboss.container.deployments-dir
  value: "/deployments"

envs:
- name: S2I_DESTINATION_DIR
  description: ^
    Root directory for S2I mount, as specified by the
    **io.openshift.s2i.destination** label.  This should not be overridden by
    end users.
  example: /tmp

- name: S2I_ARTIFACTS_DIR
  description: ^
    Location mount for artifacts persisted with **save-artifacts** script, which
    are used with incremental builds.  This should not be overridden by end users.
  example: "${S2I_DESTINATION_DIR}/artifacts}"

- name: S2I_SOURCE_DIR
  description: ^
    Location of mount for source code to be built.  This should not be
    overridden by end users.
  example: "${S2I_DESTINATION_DIR}/src}"

- name: S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR
  description: ^
    Relative path to directory containing application configuration files to be
    copied over to the product configuration directory, see
    **S2I_TARGET_CONFIGURATION_DIR**.  Defaults to **configuration**.
  example: configuration

- name: S2I_TARGET_CONFIGURATION_DIR
  description: ^
    Absolute path to which files located in
    $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR are copied.
  example: /opt/eap/standalone/configuration

- name: S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR
  description: ^
    Relative path to directory containing application data files to be copied
    over to the product data directory, see **S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR**.  Defaults
    to **data**.
  example: data

- name: S2I_TARGET_DATA_DIR
  description: ^
    Absolute path to which files located in
    $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR are copied.
  example: /opt/eap/standalone/data

- name: S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR
  description: ^
    Relative path to directory containing binary files to be copied over to the
    product deployment directory, see **S2I_TARGET_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR**.  Defaults
    to **deployments**.
  example: deployments

- name: S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_FILTER
  description: >
    Space separated list of filters to be applied when copying deployments.
    Defaults to ** * **
  value: "*"
  example: "*.jar *.war *.ear"

- name: S2I_TARGET_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR
  description: ^
    Absolute path to which files located in
    $S2I_SOURCE_DIR/$S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR are copied. Additionally, this
    is the directory to which build output is copied
  example: /deployments

- name: S2I_IMAGE_SOURCE_MOUNTS
  description: ^
    Comma separated list of relative paths in source directory which should be
    included in the image.  List may include wildcards, which are expanded
    using find.  By default, the contents of mounted directories are processed
    similarly to source folders, where the contents of
    $S2I_SOURCE_CONFIGURATION_DIR, $S2I_SOURCE_DATA_DIR, and
    $S2I_SOURCE_DEPLOYMENTS_DIR are copied to their respective target
    directories.  Alternatively, if an **install.sh** file is located in the
    root of the mount point, it is executed instead.  Deprecates
    CUSTOM_INSTALL_DIRECTORIES.
  example: extras/*

- name: S2I_ENABLE_INCREMENTAL_BUILDS
  description: ^
    Do not remove intermediate build files so they can be saved for
    use with future builds.  Defaults to true.
  example: "true"

- name: S2I_DELETE_SOURCE
  description: ^
    Delete source files at the end of build.  Defaults to true.
  example: "false"
